# 90's Rock Band Trivia Game

Homework Project #4 as part of the UCI Coding Bootcamp program

## How to play

Click the “Start” button to start the game. You will be presented 15 multiple choice questions relating to 90’s Rock Bands and their members. Each question will give you 15 seconds to answer. A timer at the top of the page will keep track of your time left for each question. Click on the answer you think is correct before time runs out. The page will show you an image of the band and indicate whether your answer was correct or not. If not, or you run out of time, it will also let you know what the correct answer was. At the end of the game you will be shown how many of your answers were correct, how many were incorrect, and how many were unanswered. You can redo the game if you click on the “Try Again” button on the last page.

## Additional thoughts

Being a big music fan, I wanted to create a game that was challenging and fun for all ages with a music based theme. This game might be difficult for people under the age of 17 since they were not even born in the 90's, but most of the bands in this game are still popular today. I also tried to follow the 90's theme with the dark graphics and grunge style imagery. I'm sure anyone who was around in the 90's can appreciate the nostalgia I tried to convey with the design.
